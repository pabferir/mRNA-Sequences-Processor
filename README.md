# mRNA Sequences Processor

![Build and Test main](https://github.com/pabferir/mRNA-Sequences-Processor/actions/workflows/gradle.yml/badge.svg)

This is my solution for the Code Challenge 1 by the ADCenter Network from Capgemini on processing mRNA sequences. A more
detailed explanation on the challenge [can be found here](doc/ADCenter_Network_Code_Challenge_Processing_mRNA_Sequences.pdf).

## Technologies
This solution is written in Java and uses Gradle for build automation.

### Why Java?
<img src="doc/java-logo.png" height="150px"/>
Java is the programming language I am most experienced with and therefore the one with which I feel most comfortable.

### Why Gradle?
<img src="doc/gradle-logo.png" height="125px"/>

[About 48% of Java developers use Gradle](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/devecosystem-2020/java/). Gradle is faster and in
my opinion provides a better and easier experience than Maven, which makes it a good option for this challenge.

## Prerequisites
You need to have [Gradle](https://gradle.org/install/) installed in order to build this project.

## Usage

To compile and build the project run the following command on the root directory:
```
> gradle build
```
To run the tests, use the command:
```
> gradle test
```

### Run with String input
To run the program specifying a String input from command line, use the command:
```
> gradle run --args="your string input"
```
> Note you should replace `your string input` with the desired input (e.g. `aucguacgugac > NM_001170833 1 auggccuuucgcuag`).

### Run with file input
To run the program with an input file, place the file in the `res/` directory and use the command:
```
> gradle run --args="-f ./res/name_of_the_file.ext"
```

### Output
Once you run the program either with String or file input, you will find the results in the `geneProc-output.txt` file generated within the `res/` directory.
